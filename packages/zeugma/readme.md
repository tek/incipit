# About

This Haskell library provides test runners for [incipit](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/incipit)-based projects,
building on [polysemy-test](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/polysemy-test), which uses
[hedgehog](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hedgehog) and [tasty](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty).

It is mere convenience to avoid the necessity of manually interpreting the commonly used effects from the bundle of
libraries that constitute Incipit.
Consult [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/zeugma/docs/Zeugma.html) for the list of runners.
